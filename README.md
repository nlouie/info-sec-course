### Passwords üîë    
#### What makes a good password?

-Never reuse passwords. 
- Forget password rules, or l33tP4ssw0rds. 
- Use a password manager to generate passwords instead
- Check if your password has been part of a data breach https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords
- Use multi-factor authentication (2FA/MFA). If your password is stolen, then the second key (on your phone) still prevents anyone from logging in.
- Phone number verification is still vulnerable to SIM Swapping, where an attacker takes over your phone #, usually through social engineering
- Preferably, use a physical key, like a Yubikey
